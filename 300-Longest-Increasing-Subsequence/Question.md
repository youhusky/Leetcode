# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

For example,  
Given `[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`,  
The longest increasing subsequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`, therefore the length is `4`. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(_n<sup>2</sup>_) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(_n_ log _n_) time complexity?
