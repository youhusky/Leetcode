# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **_n_**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

<pre>-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
</pre>

**Example:**  

<pre>n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
</pre>
