# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)

Follow up for problem "_Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node_".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

**Note:**

*   You may only use constant extra space.

For example,  
Given the following binary tree,  

<pre>         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
</pre>

After calling your function, the tree should look like:  

<pre>         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
</pre>
