# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.

For example:  
Given the below binary tree,

<pre>       1
      / \
     2   3
</pre>

Return `6`.
