# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
