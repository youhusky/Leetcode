# 191. Number of 1 Bits

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.
